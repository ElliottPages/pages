# Module Review (Year 2)

## 105 - Programming paradigms - John Fearnley

Great module with some really engaging and interesting lectures. You learn Haskell which is a functional language making it so different to any language you've ever learnt before. Probably some of the most fun assignments you'll do your whole degree. John is best lecturer :)

10/10

(This is a first year module so bare that in mind)

## 124 - Computer Systems - Stuart Thomason

Really fun module, the assembly assignment is a bit weird when getting used to assembly but super fun to do when you understand it. A decent amount of content to learn but the work is quite fundamental and with easy to listen to lectures you shouldn't struggle.

## 201 - Software Engineering - Sebastian Coope

Seb is a very nice but not the most organised of lecturers. The lecture slides for this module are sometimes very hard to make sense from due to their poor structure. The coursework mainly focuses on UML and it was useful to learn a structured UML language (like [plantUML](https://plantuml.com/)) to draw some sexy diagrams. The exam was mostly common-sense and bookwork - just hope he learns how to randomise the questions next time.

2/10

## 202 - Complexity of Algorithms - Piotr Krysta

Horrific. If you're majoring in another subject, count yourself lucky. The lecture structure doesn't work well for anyone. It seems like he expects you to watch the whole content in advance and then watch it all over again in person. He also loves to explain everything in the most mathematically formal way possible, which can be hard to understand. Most of us just learn from the slides and the tutorials. The tutorials work very well and are highly recommended if you want to make sense of what Piotr is saying.

1/10 (this is a compulsary module for most, RIP)

## 207 - Databases - Rasmus Ibsen-Jensen

This module is almost entirely about database theory. Apart from the first coursework you'll likely not spend very much time with a live database, which is disappointing. Despite his slow content, Rasmus is a good lecturer. He's got nice slides, great communication (he even replies to discussion posts!) and a uniquely dry sense of humour. Do be careful of his trick questions though; he also loves his "Where's Wally" style coding error questions. Tutorials are middling and can sometimes be quite tedious due to the theory heavy content.

5/10

## 208 - (Group Project) - No lectures but coordinator is Michele Zito

This one can vary wildly based on your group. I'd recommend sorting out your group as early as possible in the second semester, bringing lots of project ideas and making a clear time plan from the beginning. Personal comment, fuck assignment 1 and its 5 page limit with how in depth he wants the content. If you ever hear this coordinator speak, you'll genuinely wonder if its a Paul Dunne sound board.

if you get a good group and fun project then can be like a 8 or 9/10

## 211 - Computer Networks - Martin Gairing

This module is a prerequisite for Cyber Security. The module content is really good. Martin attempts to make the lectures interactive so if you answer his questions and learn the content well then this module will be a really engaging and fun. No real negatives on the module content or how it was delivered. You'll be expected to be some what proficient in Java as there are 2 Java assignments although the solutions are pretty much handed to you on a plate if you understand the lecture content and use the slides to aid your program. Exams will be very tough if you don't prepare and have no knowledge of the mathematical workings shown in the content (yes a bit of maths but literally plugging in equations and binary arithmetic).

10 / 10

## 212 - Distributed Systems - Othon Michail

COMP212 is an interesting module with a good variety of theory and practical skills. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the concepts and some algorithms behind distributed systems including: leader election; clock synchronisation; distributed algorithms and the relevant networking. The assignments are interesting, but challenging and are definitely worth getting started on early; they are both in Java and provide a good opportunity to practically implement the theoretical knowledge which really helps with understanding. The labs are poor, and the demonstrators do not know Java (which is very unhelpful); conversely, the lectures are great, they are very engaging and interesting. The course finished in Week 9, leaving ample time for revision and is my favourite this semester.

9/10

## 218 - Automata Theory - Dominik Wojtczak

A very interesting module that I quite enjoyed. The tutorial leader, [Joe Livesey](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/joe-livesey-65241a140), was amazing and a benchmark for all interactive teaching at the University. I believe he is leaving this module, so I hope whoever takes his places does just as well. This module builds through, increasingly capable, theoretical computing and language models. You'll gain a deeper understanding of regular expressions, Turing machines and how grammars work. Assessment is 100% exam based which fits the theoretical subject matter well. Although I never met him, Dominik seems like a great lecturer. His slides are great, exams are reasonable and I like his choice of [Automata Tutor](https://automata-tutor.model.in.tum.de/) to give the course some more interactivity. He also responds to discussion posts!

9/10

## 219 – Advanced AI - Huang Xiaowei

If you like listening to someone burp in a recorded lecture or enjoy that feeling of impending doom, take this module. This is probably the hardest module, a lot of math that isn’t very well described, little examples. A lot of stuff is very hard to understand, and the delivery of it is poor. The content is very interesting, it is just a  huge shame that the lecturer is lazy and generally just bad. I highly recommend that you don’t take this module if you aren’t prepared for a lot of work and stress.

**This is a prerequisite for a lot of 3rd year modules**

I asked for a score out of 10 and they asked can it be negative lol.

## 221 - Planning your Career - Valentina / Alexis

This module is pass/fail. If you do the reflections to some degree of detail then you'll pass. The *lectures* are pretty much telling you the same stuff every week asides from some weeks where they do interview and assessment centre stuff. **You have to do this module if you do year in industry.** I know of people who just put the work off until last 2 weeks and they did fine but of course no one recommends this. Alexis and Valentina are engaging so at least the lectures aren't done by someone who's monotone and boring. Also make sure when you get a placement you announce it in the chat because the love it haha.

6/10

## 222 - Game Design - Konstantinos Tsakalidis

Coordinator: Seems to have genuine interest in the subject, and is actively pushing for a larger coursework weighting. Explains things fairly well from the few lectures I've attended.

Lectures: Slow but competent. I have only attended a couple, and have not watched any of the recordings, so take this with a grain of salt.

Content: Interesting topics, though I haven't paid much attention to material itself. Game engines, physics, theory and code design (IE data structures and paradigms) are all covered. I like the theory covered and think it is well structured. The only bit of theory I did not like is the jMonkeyEngine section. jME is a Java game engine that the module teaches. It is optional (I ignored everything on it after I realised how awful the engine and library is), but if you do not use it you will have to learn Unity or Unreal (I think Unreal is an option) in your own time. Most people I know went for Unity.

Assignments: We had two assignments. The first was to recreate the game Asteroids. You can use jME or another engine like Unity, I recommend Unity. It is a fun assignment, with 20% of the mark devoted to your own custom features. The second is even more open, and focused on AI. You have to either use Robocode or add AI to your assignment 1 submission in some form.

Additional Notes: The modules seems to be undergoing change, so some details may not be accurate for next year.

7/10

Good module overall, though I didn't pay attention to much of the material

## 226 - Trading in financial markets - Ruhal Savani

Lecturer is very good, explains things well. Module is very well organised and easy to follow. You'll learn about several trading concepts and will implement them in R. R is a little different to most programming languages but I've found it easy to use, and it's good to get experience with as many different languages as possible. Assignments are well explained and use CodeGrade which gives feedback before submission. After assignments have been graded Rahul gives excellent feedback allowing for improvement. Two assignments worth 15% each and one exam for 70%. Overall a very good module which has taught a lot of new concepts in a way which is both easy to understand and keep on top of.

9/10

## 228 - App Development - Phil Jimmieson

The assignments for this module are really fun. First one is make a simple iPhone game, second being a map based app making use of sensors and context etc. The labs for this module are super helpful in learning some of the quirks that come with swift and getting used to XCode which can be a pain in the arse. It really helps for this module if you do have an apple computer but don't worry if you don't, the uni just bought a bunch of M1 chip iMacs so you'll have nice new ones to play with next year. The lecture content is good but long and can be very draining to watch. Phil could do with cutting it down slightly into smaller videos to make it a bit easier to pace them. Phil is also the **BEST** lecturer I've seen conduct labs. He will give you all the help you need and seems to have debugged every error to ever exist. Ever. Like it's stupid his level of swift knowledge. One major downside that the whole module endured was simply lack of iMacs at the uni. There is only the one lab in the George Holt building and when it comes close to deadline day you have to be in the iMac suite early to get a hold of one for the day. Hence the remark on really good if you have a MacBook.

Side note, Phil mentioned he worked on early versions of Mac OS so probs explains his amazing knowledge.

9/10

## 229 - Data Science - Matthew Bright

FYI the normal lecturer left teaching last minute so we had a new one take it up last minute which most likely changed the experience of the module.

All our lectures were delivered via Teams live with recordings directly from the teams meetings available after. The recordings were pretty hard to find and often missing parts or cut into multiple sections.
The lectures themselves were pretty good the lecturer clearly tried to have a lot of interactivity so was asking questions for people to answer (although this of course led to a lot of dead air...) but overall it was clear he wanted to get you thinking.
The content follows quite closely from COMP116 (and also overlaps in some places) but also includes some pretty simple stats that I did in A-level maths. I would say you need to be pretty interested in this area of CS to do it as it is definitely not an easy pass.
The  assessment was 70/30 exam/coursework although don't be fooled the 30% was for a class test just before Christmas. The exam/test seemed challenging but overall quite fair and for the most part the methods required were findable in the lecture notes/pdf. Unlike most other CS modules the final exam included some written questions that some people struggled to get in on time. I unfortunately had to rush to submit at the end so got a final matrix incorrect ( yes lots of matrices ;) )

I'd give it a solid 6/10, but definitely worth it if you're interested in Data Science

## 232 - Cyber Security - Jeffery Ray

This module has some of the most engaging lecture content out of the modules sat so far. Often Jeffery uses the content hes just explained to give you real life cyber examples of where this might be used like target social engineering and target malware. He also goes over some extra things you don't need to know but is super interesting like instances of different malware, what it did, who made it, the ethics, etc. Just a really engaging module. This review is written after just handing in assignment 1 and this is Probably one of the more difficult ones as it is a lab report and you won't have written a proper one until you do this assignment. You will also be expected to be fairly proficient in Java and/or Python to do the labs and background research for assignments. Overall a great module with a great lecturer provided you put in the work and attend the lectures.

9/10

## 281 - C and Memory Management - Phil Jimmieson

Super fun module and a super easy pick if you already know C or Rust or something similar. Programming in C is slightly different but no less fun than most languages. With Phil back again teaching this module, the lectures are great. Much shorter than the ones he did for App dev and he does go over the basics like printing and control flow etc but there isn't much else to go over other than the points and Memory allocation at the end of the module. The assignments are pretty good, mostly programming tasks you'll see in interview questions but that's not a bad thing. Again Phil in the labs, hes super good so the help provided is over probably the best quality. Pick this module, its one of the best ones this year. If you're sick of OOP, take this module. Pre-prerequisite to Advanced OOP.

10/10

## 282 - Advanced Object-Oriented C Languages - Rasmus Ibsen-Jensen

Following straight after COMP281, this module builds on your newfound knowledge of C by teaching C++ and C#. Rasmus is at it again, with his clear slides and calming voice. To be honest, you can skip the tutorials. He does so many examples in the lectures you'll probably have no trouble with the two coding assignments.

8/10

## 283 - Applied Database management - Who knows

That boring looking, no one even picked it lol.

?/10

## 284 - Scripting Languages - Ullrich Hustadt

This module focuses on PHP and JavaScript scripting, having you build a [booking system](https://student.csc.liv.ac.uk/~sgbwesto/gym.php) in PHP and a [simple game](https://student.csc.liv.ac.uk/~sgbwesto/game) in JavaScript. There is some expectation to learn the basics of HTML and CSS in your own time but some HTML constructs and ideas are taught. I find Ullrich to be a very good lecturer. He has immaculate slides, teaches well and ensures you complete his weekly regiment of tutorial activities, for fear of automated emails. I would recommend the tutorials as they are very helpful for the assignments and in learning the content.

9/10

## 220/285 - Computer Aided Software Development) - Sebastian Coope

Although the slides for this module are much more legible than COMP201, this is still a Seb module. The assignments are poorly organised and littered with inconsistencies, just like a real devops project! The content between the full module and the half module is identical and they only differ in their assessment. COMP285 is all coursework based, with assessment on making build files for the Ant build tool and writing tests for the JUnit test suite. Seb appears to be a major proponent of the Eclipse IDE but say's he hasn't used it in years when asked for troubleshooting advice. I wouldn't recommend even looking at Eclipse. Using Ant and JUnit directly will greatly enhance your learning experience and give you greater flexibility in writing your solutions.
