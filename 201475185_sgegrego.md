## 1014 - Area and Circumference of circles

The solution to this problem was centred round 1 for loop which iterates for the number of times of the 2 radius differ by ie `int steps = r2-r1` so r1 = 8 r2 = 12 then iterate 4 times to get inclusively the amount of areas and Circumference between 2 radius.

I used the r1 variable as the radius through out and just incremented it to save on memory.

In the print statement I specify a 3 decimal point accuracy to be printed as like the solution output on Online Judge.

## 1018 - Reverse String

In this exercise you could not use arrays so I went for a recursive approach. I decided to use the getc function for this one as it just grabs the next character on the input which seemed to work better than how scanf was dealing with it. To find getc I just googled alternatives to scanf and read through some of the c documentation online.

This solution works because every time it is pushed on the stack then it is essentially going into reverse order for me. Once getc sees `\nEOF` then it will terminate and this will cause the stack to unwind all the functions not returned. This starts from the most recent function first and this prints in order of most recent - first function call. As the stack is first in last out, we get a reverse string without event storing the entire string.

## 1022 - Count characters in a string

In this solution, I made use of a feature in C which is that assigning a character to an int type produces it's ascii code. I found this out as I knew Java does it so I tested it and sure enough C did too.

With that now, I used a switch statement to check ranges of character codes which also avoids a pyramid of doom of if statements. You can also use ranges in switch statements which are inclusive so rather than checking for each number, I can check for blocks of them.

I also make use of a while loop condition which checks to see of scanf reads a character and if the function returns 0 then it did not and the loop should break. I also have a check for the `\n` character just in case as some of my own testing revealed the loop condition was not sufficient in all cases but this was.

## 1030 - Precise division

In this solution, it quickly came apparent that the use of a double or a float to store the quotient number. This was due to the limitations of storing those size numbers to an accurate decimal place. This lead me to look at takling this with long division with remainders and _modulo_ (to use that term lightly) arithmetic.

I thought that be just storing the remainder of the number then I can do it using entirely whole numbers. That if we compute the remainders to out decimal point accuracy then just compute the integer division, We should in theory get the first the nth (n = accuracy inputted) digit of decimal point.

## 1032 - String Search

This algorithm that I have written is really naive in construction as there is nothing to deal with the consideration of _what is a word?_ In my algorithm, simply doing `Hello World` and l and d as s2 and s3 would pass and print some valid outputs as we haven't dealt with d and l being chars not words. This is because I believed it did not matter, it wants substrings not a word search.

I used fgets for this as when scanf was using null bytes between words where as fgets does until `\n` or `EOF`. This meant for easier checks when getting lengths for looping conditions.

There to my knowledge is a way to do this in `O(n)` time but I was struggling getting it working so I decided on just loops as the conditions started to get rather complex and as the restrictions did satisfy for this solution then it did not matter as much.

I had to do 2 separate nested loops words can differ in length.
