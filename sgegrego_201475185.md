For this challenge, I felt it was easiest to check if I read an end of file and if not then read in the next character. This works for expand and compress.

### expand

The input to expand had a couple of methods of telling you when where end of a sequence is. There was 2 characters to represent what character it will be **only if** it has a number afterwards. Otherwise if it was a character on its own then it would just be 2 sequential different characters which I used to find out characters that were encoded of length 1. There was also a delimiter which was `*`. This was also a character that could be used but I always checked if the prev was a number so it was fine.

### compress

Compressing worked very well for reading in character by character. You only need to check for new lines and changed characters. You just kept count and if you only counted 1 char then don't bother compressing, just add that char on. You also print the new lines to differentiate the lines on the actual expand as this is used to put characters across a new line

For this program I used a structure and instantiated this structure using malloc and stored pointers to those instances in an array. This meant I was not creating lots of new arrays and copying arrays about but instead just stored pointers to only one instance of the strings and count. I also ignore punctuation and just read in the next character when I see it. The only time I split the words is on space or newline as those are what follow the punctuation.
