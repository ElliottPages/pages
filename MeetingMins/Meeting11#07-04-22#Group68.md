# Meeting 11 07/04/22

## Attendees
- Elliott
- Cameron
- Joe
- Tom
- Barney
- Michele Zito

## Agenda

- Explain what we have to Michele and the problem to overcome with reducing conflicts and have grouping on graph to develop a possible algorithm we could use

## Meeting Notes

### Nodal representation of data

Will have an email with how to shorten lines on graph, easy to do

### Problem

Just visulising data has enough scope for project? 

Explanation of what project is
- Children give friendships
- generates graph to visualise the the relationship
- also generates table and highlights in red the kids in need of what Ykids offer

vertex degree is quite primitive in this scenario, something like this used on web

When looking for information on the web, for instances google ranks what they think is importance to the user by their prediction. something similar what we want to do here

Vertex degree can be used here, but we could do something more on here. Obvious is page rank algorithm (look at google again)

Page rank is the direction michele would go in, look into this.

feasible as we have a couple weeks.

### Any places we can look

This meeting was good, Michele has keywords.

Michele will send us some links to things we can look at

How big are the networks? 30-40 on average but we would like to expand bigger than this to probably double this for safety and expansion

### How can Michele contact us?

We will set up a teams to quickly communicate with Michele just for quick ease 

Will find stuff in javascript for us

### Additional comments

- Split 2 directional arrows into 2 nodes for complexity?
	- We already have this

### Need to set up a MS teams
