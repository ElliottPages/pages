Socialgraph

### Tutorial - What needs to be covered

#### Student

Provide set number of friends from closest to least closest, max number can be set by teacher
 
#### Teacher

Teacher sets up data page, number of kids (input their names manually or through csv), max amount of children

Teacher set a pin so when children submit their friends, they cannot see other people's inputs

Export the data as CSV to be sent to ykids.

DATA COLLECTION MAY NOT BE POLISHED AND OR DONE.

#### Ykids Staff

Import CSV which will generate new graph using force-directed algorithm or JSON that holds coords

Manually edit data through table: add friends, delete a friend, delete/add nodes, drag and drop to change relationship level, edit names of nodes

Loading a CSV will automatically trigger our organisation algorithm

Analyse graph - explain bi-directional arrows, single arrows, what node size means (smaller = less relationships), people with less links will go to edges, table view has colours to specify indegree on the left (people who like them) and out degree on the right (people they like) for each node

Set name of data, input this into text field in menu bar

Store exported files, export as desired format to be shared. Say also "we reccomend the ykids sharepoint for safe storage."

Can pan and zoom on the graph using left click to drag and move and scroll wheel to zoom

Click a node to highlight its relationships, can also shift click to select more than one node

Single click on a node to highlight it on table. CURRENT BUG: if you double click a node then single click another, te first node in table still highlighted
