## Week 4 work - Data collection

### Adding children first

Register gets added first in some means, could import a list or prefilled graph could be used

Also allow adding children in the software

### Store the state of register and graph etc so refreshing page doesn't lose anything

local storage could be used here to prevent loss on refresh

### Child friend input page

page for the children to input friends

The children should only ever see their page and none else

^ Include this in tool tips - cannot lety kids run lose but bring them up one at a time and do this

### Pin barrier on submit button

cannot go to next page without a pin possibly

### possibly only show one choice at a time

hide choices as they are made so only one child could see one other child's name
