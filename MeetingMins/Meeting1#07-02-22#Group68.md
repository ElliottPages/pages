## Agenda

Get a better idea of the scope of the project.

Chance to ask questions and clarify some ideas with the client.

Bounce Ideas back and forth with the client to create a scope that would be suitable for the ultimate goal of the system.

## What is the product we are creating

Primary school children cope with emotional challenges in school.

Identification tool that create a friendship graph by the children naming who their friends are in the class and it comes up with a useful diagram of the relationships between the children to gauge the social dynamics of the class.

Looking particularly for bullying. This will also help identify if they children needs any emotional support based on their friends and how they stand in the class.

Done by identifying friend and people who don't like said child to identify who does/doesn't have friends, strong bonds, and making sure everyone has a couple or one top 5 friend form another child.

Make the process of finding this simpler.

Also need to illustrate to the parent with the diagram why this child will benefit from the support.

Make this data gathered into an app.
- Capture data from some kind of input (CSV was mentioned)
- done by class activity by the teacher to collect friend lists from each child (hence probably done in excel)
   - the input
- from that needs to come out as a graph noted in the files

Direction of relationship is needed.

Bi-directional arrows to show both like each other.

We know from the graph that ones with lots of green arrows have lots of friends and ones that have no arrows or red don't have.

Phone/Tablet app preferred but laptop app can be done.

Will allow teach to input straight into app and give other staff who deal with emotional support the diagram.

### Any limitations between teacher and emotional support staff?

Should be done, as both staff may have very limited technical knowledge so should be super easy to use.

Possibly option for input on app and take in a CSV file.

Less error in the way to input into the app directly so this is preffered option.

### What does the colour scheme on the graph mean?

The help to show not just direction but the strength of relationship.

Blue is recipricated friendship for example.

Colour scheme is really down to us, as long as there is a definition. (a key probably required)

### CSV file? What's the benefit if we just have them input in the app?

Just easier for teacher to put into app, had CSV in the past and is easier to play with when using Excel with a csv.

Can have option to export CSV as may be useful for other data manipulation.

Can be useful to have it take in a CSV for legacy.

Thinking about if a mobile app, harder to input a CSV.

### Would holding in cloud be useful?

Cost is a challenge and GDPR as we are using children names.

If you can overcome this, yes if not then keep it local as easier as the benefit might not be worth it.

Clumping together the friendship groups will be useful.

### The UI is important

Have lightweight, easy to use

not information overload

has to be responsive

cant redraw every time is needed

### Other Thoughts

Just compare images in-terms of looking at past and present diagrams.

Having a facility to compare (have some images overlaying or side by side) wouldn't store this just have an Upload facility.

Need a naming strategy between nodes and graphs if looking at two graphs.

Will be useful to focus in on one child and one friendship groups

Difference in how friendship has changed

Allow user to manipulate the image

Live interactive diagram; so being able to hold a live version that can be changed on the go allowing the user to print current versions of the graph to be able to physically snapshot it.
