## Notes from meeting

### Update contributions/what have

- Elliott
	- Nodes.js, export-csv.js, JSDoced and Tests for export-csv
- Tom
	- Node,js, export-csv.js, set up build environment, Designed graph nodes, tests on graph nodes, did basic rendering
- Barney
	- importcsv/parse.js, made tests
- joe
	- Styled all the nodes and graph output, menu to come (wasn't 100% confident due to technical difficulties)
- Ben
	- create outline of design document overall (includes tidy up and edit requirements for week 1, title page, contents, abstract, dictionary page, set up main body of design)
- Cameron
	- initial design, looking ahead for designing later weeks and make sure we will meet it if we need to pour more time into it, organisation stuff for project management


### need to make decision on document format

Do we do it by week by week and split into design and implementation or version name then have sub heading for design implentation and testing?

Pick option 2 - version name and 3 sections.

### What needs to be done this week that wasn't done last week?

Link up all week 1 stuff when they are induvidually done

Still working on edges beneath nodes - Tom 

export as image - joe

save friendship map - outputting with positions csv/JSON with coords on for x and y - Elliott

show GRD in a simple table alongside map - Barney

testing - also design tests - if you write toe code, write the test

make sure to JSDoc it all - all

more descriptive commits - all

UIStuff - Joe

### Review Data structure

In future - design first then ask everyone then implement (doesn't have to be nice design as is Ben's job to prettify it)

Analyse runtime of queries - was done as a map and this can be hell to work with

Reccomendation from Cameron - adjacency matrix - is go to way to store graphs so it needs to be discussed anyway

Why did we chose map? is quick to get up and running to get some progress with rendering etc

Move to adjacency matrix, assign in week 2

### Tom is going to look into SVG implementation over canvas and rendering engine

### Assignment in week 2 task

- Ben
	- Design doc, pulling comments together into nice descriptions
- Barney
	- work on making table interactive
- Tom
	- get SVG done quick, take visualisation stuff and add in if we go down SVG route
- Elliott
	- Switch to adjacency matricies
- Cameron
	- movement of node
- Joe
	- visualisation, menu UI, UI/UX


Look into contacting Darran on friday.
