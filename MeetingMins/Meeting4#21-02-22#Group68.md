### This weeks task - Plan out sprints and set the foundation

- Versions Document: what each sprint should do
   - Architectural Analysis: identifying subsystems

- file input
   - CSV/(xlsx - stretch goal maybe later on)

- Present multiple UI

First 3 version come together to be the first draft of the software
